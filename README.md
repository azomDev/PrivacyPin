# PrivacyPin
Most things said in this readme might not be implemented and are subject to change

PrivacyPin is a secure location sharing app that prioritizes user privacy by giving the user complete control over their location by not only controlling who can see the user's location and when, but it can also notify the user that someone accessed their position in real time.

It also aims to provide levels of encryption that are probably overkill for what it is, without (really) affecting performances.
