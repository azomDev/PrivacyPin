# PrivacyPin

PrivacyPin is a secure, FOSS and self-hosted location sharing app designed to prioritize user privacy. It offers complete control over location sharing, allowing users to determine who can access their location and when. Additionally, it provides real-time notifications when someone accesses their position.

## Key Features

-   **User-Controlled Location Sharing**: Users have full control over who can view their location and when it is visible.
-   **Real-Time Access Notifications**: Receive notifications whenever someone accesses your position.
-   **Self-Hostable Server**: The server is self-hostable, ensuring that users do not rely on big tech companies to access their location data.

## Usage

PrivacyPin is still in early development, and the usage instructions will be provided once the app reaches a stable version. Stay tuned for updates!
