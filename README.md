# Nostalgic UI
> This is the new UI I(@KitCatLove) have made for Privacy Pin.
> This UI is sleek and modern, while bringing back that good old memories.
> I love it, Azom(@AzomDev) seems to like it, and yeah! Enjoy!

> > I honestly shouldn't be in charge of this, and I won't give you my email or Signal, so if you want to do something, ask Azom(@AzomDev)(His email and Signal are in the README.md on the main branch), and he will tell me what I'm doing wrong or need to add or whatever you might need.
